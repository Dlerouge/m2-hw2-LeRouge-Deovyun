        <h1>De'ovyun LeRouge</h1>

        <p> My name is De'ovyun LeRouge and I'm getting my Master'
            degree in Mass Communicaiton and Journalism with a 
            concentration in Web Design and Online Communication.
            I am currently a middle school coding teacher and my hope
            is to become a front-end web developer.
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

        <p> As much as I love coding, my hobbies don't actually include
            any type of coding. I am a music enthusiast, my favorite genre
            has got to be heavy metal. When I'm not listening to music,
            you can find me reading. I don't watch a lot of tv, I have a
            hard time finding shows that capture my attention. But, I tend 
            to like shows and movies in the horror genre. Every once in a while
            I'll watch a Marvel movie, Transformers movie, Disney movie or anime.
        </p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>

        <p>As I said before, my favorite music genre is heavy metal. Having
            said that, one of the things I'm planning on adding to my list
            of hobbies is guitarist. I want to learn how to play the electric
            guitar. It has been a dream of my since I was a little kid, but I
            wasn't able to then. I thought it would be suitable to also list
            my favorite book genre's here.
        </p>

        <h3>My Favorite Book Genres</h3>

       <ul>
            <li>Romance</li>
            <li>Fantasy</li>
            <li>Paranormal</li>
            <li>Adventure</li>
            <li>Sci-fi</li>
            <li>Dark Fantasy</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Even though I listed all those genres, I honestly can not read a 
            book without romance in it. If it doesn't have romance there's
            a good chance I either won't read it or I won't finish it. I can
            honestly say that my favorite author is Sarah J. Maas, though I do
            believe that the last book she wrote was lacking, her first two
            series, Throne of Glass, and a Court of Thorns and Roses, was great.
            My favorite is a Court of Thorns and Roses and I'm planning on
            getting a tattoo inspired by that book. If you want to check her out,
            I'll include the link to her website below.

        <h2>Career Goals</h2>

        <p>I can't say that I have a detailed list of career goals, but I have an
            idea of what I want to do and where to start to achieve it.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Create a Portfolio</li>
            <li>Earn my Master's Degree</li>
            <li>Get a job as a Front-end Web Developer</li>
            <li>Work my way up the ladder to become Sr. Front-End Web Developer</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Thank you!</h2>

        <p>So, there's a little bit about myself to help you get to know me better
            and maybe even to understand me.
